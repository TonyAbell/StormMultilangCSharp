Storm multilang for C#
====================
Multilang console app for c# yay!

Storm is a #awesome distributed real-time computing thingy and people doing big data stuff need distributed real-time computing thingys. 
It’s simple
Big lump o’machines with storm installed on them…
A concept called a “Spout” that injects data into the lump.
A concept called a “bolt” that processes data inside the lump.

*Righteous fist pump*

And because I’m kind I’ll let you into a secret, it supports multiple languages for its spouts and bolts. Someone pass me a cushion!
The multilang protocol basically fires up a shell application and uses stdin stdout to do stuff…
This protocol has official implementations (as of writing this for python, ruby and a few others)

But today, via me *drum roll* it also supports c#!

Enough of your inane drivel 
====================
So I’ve included some test stuff to help you! 
1.	Get the source.
2.	Build the visual studio project.
3.	Maven Package the test wordcount project (thanks storm people I totally stole that project)
4.	Deploy to storm.

I would go into more detail for step 1, 2, 3 and 4 but I’m drinking beer right now so I won’t
Enjoy

*One more fist pump*
